Analyzed sales data from a toy store chain using **SQL, Python, and Power BI** to uncover key business insights. I cleaned and structured the data in **Pandas**, stored it in an **SQLite** database, and wrote SQL queries to identify top-selling products, revenue trends, and store performance. Using **Matplotlib**, I visualized trends in product demand and seasonal sales fluctuations.

Conclusions / Insights:

- The top 5 stores accounted for a significant portion of total revenue, with Mexico City locations leading sales.
- Art & Crafts and Toys emerged as the highest-selling categories, contributing over 50% of total units sold.
- Seasonal sales patterns showed strong performance during holiday periods, with December and March experiencing peak revenue.
