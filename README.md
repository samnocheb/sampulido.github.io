Analyzed sales data from a toy store chain using **SQL, Python, and Power BI** to uncover key business insights. I cleaned and structured the data in **Pandas**, stored it in an **SQLite** database, and wrote SQL queries to identify top-selling products, revenue trends, and store performance. Using **Matplotlib**, I visualized trends in product demand and seasonal sales fluctuations.

Conclusions / Insights:

- The top 5 stores accounted for a significant portion of total revenue, with Mexico City locations leading sales.
- Art & Crafts and Toys emerged as the highest-selling categories, contributing over 50% of total units sold.
- Seasonal sales patterns showed strong performance during holiday periods, with December and March experiencing peak revenue.

### Glassdoor Job Reviews Analysis

Analyzed 200 thousand Glassdoor job reviews to uncover key drivers of employee satisfaction. Using **Python, data visualization, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling**, I cleaned and structured the dataset, explored trends in workplace ratings, and applied **NLP** to assess employee sentiments. I also performed hypothesis testing to determine whether employees who recommend their company tend to have higher satisfaction scores and built a linear regression model to predict job ratings based on workplace factors.
Conclusions / Insights

- Work-life balance and career opportunities strongly correlate with job satisfaction, making them key factors in employee retention.
- Sentiment analysis revealed that even positive reviews often mention improvement areas, highlighting nuanced employee perceptions.
- Employees who recommend their company have significantly higher satisfaction ratings, as confirmed by hypothesis testing.
